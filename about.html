    Hi, my name is <strong>Ildar</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was the programmer behind a series of snazzy games of chance (take a look through my portfolio).  Now I build stunning websites using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>jQuery</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My specialty is dynamic, fluid and responsive browser candy.  If you are a fellow freelancer or a design agency and are looking for a front-end programmer to partner with I would love to hear from you.
