## Installation

You will need:

* [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) with [nib](https://tj.github.io/nib/) extensions

Instructions:

* Rename **config-example.php** to **config.php**
* Edit config.php (it is pretty much self-explanatory)
* Edit about.html
* Compile Stylus to CSS: `stylus -u nib skins/*/*.styl`
* Host on a PHP server

If you have PHP 5.4 or later you can start a local server by running: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8888`

Advanced:

* [Change](http://xiconeditor.com/) favicon.ico
* <a name="static"></a>Render a static page with `php index.php > index.html` to serve quicker and without invoking the PHP interpreter
